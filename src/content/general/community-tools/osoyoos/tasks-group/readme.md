|------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| FBX                | Converts an FBX file to a JMS file that Tool can then read to convert to a level.                                                                                         | This option only applies to an MCC profile
| Browse             | Pressing this button will ask the user to browse for a JMS to import with tool. The user can also select a scenario tag to light a level without the need for a JMS file. | If a scenario is selected then the only option for the user will be to light it.
| Import Only        | This is one option in a set of 3. If this option is set then only the level importing process will be started.                                                            |
| Light Only         | This is one option in a set of 3. If this option is set then only the level lighting process will be started.                                                             |
| Import and Light   | This is one option in a set of 3. If this option is set then the JMS will first be imported and then lit.                                                                 |
| Light Threshold    | A slider that sets how long the lightmapper should go for because it calls the job done. Values on the right take longer than values on the left.                         |
| Draft              | The lightmapper will run in draft mode. Takes less total time to complete than final.                                                                                     |
| Light              | The lightmapper will run in final mode. Takes more total time to complete than draft.                                                                                     |
| Apply Phantom Fix  | This will set the phantom fix arg to true during level importing. This will attempt to fix any possible invisible walls generated during import at the cost of tag space. | This option only applies to an MCC profile
| Disable Asserts    | This will set the -NoAssert arg during level lighting. Should grant some additional speed ups by disabling error checking. Only use if you know the tag has no issues.    | This option only applies to an MCC profile
| Import/Light level | Pressing this will run either level import and lighting commands with the settings set above.                                                                             |

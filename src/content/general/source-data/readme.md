Some **Source data file** formats are shared between the different versions of the [Blam engine](~engine).
These are the assets which have not yet been converted into tags. In most cases, assets within `data` will have a corresponding tag under the same folder layout in `tags`.
Each engine revision will have a different process for converting these but the data itself is often similar.

      This is probably not an issue with your tags, but rather Sapien failing to
      initialize its sound system (perhaps after device changes or system sleep).
      Restart your system or put `sound_enable 0` into Sapien's `editor_init.txt`
      if you don't need to hear sounds in Sapien for now. Also ensure you don't
      have any scripts setting `sound_set_music_gain` over 1.

      You are running out of memory in HEK Sapien. Try freeing up more physical memory on your system, and/or using a [large address aware Sapien](#limits) or H1A Sapien instead.

    solution: >-
      You have a [bitmap](~) tag which is too large. Do not exceed dimensions of 2048 pixels because support is GPU-dependent; technically DirectX 9 did not allow sizes over this limit. This issue is fixed in [H1A Sapien](~h1-sapien) as it updated to DX11 which doesn't have this issue.

      A [detail object](~detail_object_collection) was painted outside the map. Be careful when painting around corners and small spaces, and save frequently. Presumed fixed in H1A Sapien.

    solution: >-
      This may be caused by a multi-core processor. Try running in Windows 98 compatibility mode, or setting the process affinity to a single core using Task Manager before opening the scenario. This issue is fixed in [H1A Sapien](~h1-sapien).

      An [object](~) has _transparent self occlusion_ enabled while also referencing a transparent [shader](~) with _extra layers_. This is not a problem in-game. This issue is fixed in [H1A Sapien](~h1-sapien).

    solution: >-
      This error happens when firing positions cannot detect a BSP surface, possibly from being outside the BSP. This may have happened if the BSP has changed shape since they were placed. Switch through each of your BSPs and look for firing positions in the _Hierarchy view_ with a red X beside them. Remove then recreate these firing positions.

      EXCEPTION halt in c:\mcc\main\h1\code\h1a2\sources\tag_files\tag_groups.c,#4440: #2 is not a valid scenario_detail_object_collection_palette_block index in [#0,#2)
    solution: >-
      You've possibly painted detail objects into the BSP and saved the BSP tag using Sapien, but not yet saved the scenario tag. This will result in Standalone not being able to find the palette entry.

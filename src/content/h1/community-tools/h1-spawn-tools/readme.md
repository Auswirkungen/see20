The **H1 Spawn Tools** repository (presented by insidi0us & stunt_man) is a collection of tools provided for level designers to optimize spawn point placement in a map, for balanced competitive play. With these tools, map creators can visualize how the game's spawn selection logic will work in real-time. There are instructions for generating "randoms" geometry, placing spawn marker scenery at all Slayer spawn points, and more.

# Included Tools & Resources

* Halo Spawn Shop Blender add-on
* Custom spawn marker scenery object
* Example of compiled Hang 'Em High randoms geometry scenery object
* Windows Batch file for placing spawn marker scenery in a scenario (uses [Invader](~invader))

{% alert %}
These tools & resources were designed for use with the H1EK, released with the PC Port of Halo: The Master Chief Collection, and for Blender. They may not be fully compatible with files created with the original Custom Edition HEK and are not intended for use with 3DS Max scenes.

title: Singleplayer design
about: guide
---
Singleplayer levels can be much more complex to design than multiplayer levels. They may include multiple BSPs, AI encounters, [scripting](~scripting), cutscenes, [recorded animations](~recorded-animations), and more. The original HEK tutorial didn't cover SP mapping so much of our knowledge has been built up over the years and documented in tutorials.

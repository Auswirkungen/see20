            If enabled, any headshot against an unshielded enemy will kill it
            regardless of the amount of damage inflicted. Even a 1-damage pistol
            still instantly kills a Hunter because of this flag. It is an
            instant kill even if the shield threshold is met with a headshot
            (after shields have been reduced to 0 by the damage effect but
            health is full). For example, even though the pistol deals 25 damage
            and players have 75 shield vitality, if the final shot is a headshot
            the player dies.

            Although there is also a _can cause multiplayer headshots_ flag, it
            has a separate meaning and this flag applies to both SP and MP.

            A model's headshot area is determined by its `head`
            [region](~gbxmodel#regions).

            If enabled, causes the effect to trigger the explosion of dropped
            grenades within its radius, used for explosion chaining. This only
            applies to maps loaded in singleplayer mode. Note that the [item](~)
            receiving damage (e.g. the grenade [equipment](~)) must also have its
            _destroyed by explosions_ flag enabled. If the grenade has been
            placed within the scenario in Sapien, the _does accelerate_ flag
            will also need to be checked in the properties window.

            Applies a 2x damage multiplier to headshots in multiplayer (based on
            how the map was loaded, not scenario type). This multiplier stacks
            with material modifiers below, so for example a cyborg armor
            modifier of 2 with this flag enabled results in a 4x headshot damage
            modifier.

            A model's headshot area is determined by its `head`
            [region](~gbxmodel#regions).

            The minimum radius determines the sphere in which damage is 100% of
            _damage upper bound_. Damage fades linearly to _damage lower bound_
            at the maximum radius. Outside the maximum radius, 0 damage is
            dealt. The _aoe core radius_ field does not affect this calculation.

            Controls how long camera shaking lasts. In H1CE and H1CE, short camera
            shakes (0.05) get skipped occasionally at high FPS since this feature is
            still [tied to frame rate](~renderer#gearbox-regressions). This is fixed
            and interpolated by [Chimera](~) and by H1A natively.

            Objects within this radius will be damaged regardless of
            obstructions in the [BSP](~scenario_structure_bsp). Outside this
            radius, there must be a line of sight between the effect and target.
            Contrary to the Guerilla tooltip, this field does not determine if
            the damage has an area of effect; see _radius_.

            The number of cells between this attachment point and the next.
            The final attachment point should use the value `0`. For example,
            a flag with 3 attachment points and _height_ of `9` vertices should
            use attachment point heights of `4`, `4`, and `0` respectively.

            is empty or the marker does not exist then the point will attach
            to the object's root node.

            Determines the number of vertices the trailing edge shape is offset.
            A value `0` places the shape exactly on the trailing edge. Positive
            values will push it off the edge of the flag while negative values
            will move it inwards.

            of attachment points.

            vertices (cells+1), not the number of cells.

            Flag size along the direction of attachment. This counts the number of
            vertices (cells+1), not the number of cells. This value should be 1
            higher than the sum of all attachment points'
            [_height to next attachment_](#tag-field-attachment-points-height-to-next-attachment)
            or else the flag will not appear. This must also be an odd number
            or else the flag will not appear or be streteched to the world origin (0, 0, 0).

            A series of attachment points for the flag's attached edge. There must
            be at least 2 attachment points or the flag will be ignored.

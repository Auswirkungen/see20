            [Object lighting](~object#shadows-and-lighting) samples the lightmap
            near the object, rather than the ground point directly below it like
            most objects do.

            Determines how long a door will stay open for once it has reached a
            fully open position, even once [eligible bipeds](#automatic-doors)
            have left the activation radius.

            This value is derived from _door open time_ and is compared at
            runtime to the number of ticks a door-typed machine has been fully
            open. If the door has been open for more ticks than this value, its
            desired device group position will be set to 0 causing the door to
            begin closing.
